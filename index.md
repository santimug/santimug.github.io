My doctoral research investigated the topographic controls on Antarctic Ice Sheet flow and retreat by leveraging high-resolution bathymetry from deglaciated landscapes to gain insight into local- and subglacial-scale processes governing ice sheet dynamics.
- Characterizing bed roughness on the Antarctic continental margin
- Insights on retreat patterns in the Western Ross Sea from morphometric analysis of small-scale ice-marginal landforms
- Investigating grounding zone wedge geometry using a one-dimensional Coulomb-plastic flow model
